Nice to be a part of a larger, cooler community of DST4L

So far I have been confused learning these tools

* [Refinepro](https://app.refinepro.com)
* [API] (www.dtu.dk)
* [github] (https://github.com/githubteacher/dst4l-sept201)
* [atom] (https://www.atom.io)

### As someone said, a quote I enjoy to "re-use"
> knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit,
> wisdom is knowing not to put it in a fruit salad
